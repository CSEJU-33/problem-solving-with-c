<p><i><b>Assalamu Alaikum</b></i> everyone of JU CSE-33,</p>
<p>I am Rakin Al Shahriar, your batchmate, studying CSE at the Islamic University of Technology (IUT). I genuinely wanted to contribute, and here we go.</p>
<p>Please use <b>"Alt + Z"</b> to enable word wrap mode if you are viewing these code from VS Code; it will help you read without using the vertical bar.</p>
<p>However, I tried to write all the code by myself, taking very little help from AI. If you find any errors or have any suggestions, please let me know.</p>
