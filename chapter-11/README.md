<i><b>Assalamu Alaikum</b></i> everyone of JU CSE-33,  
I am **Rakin al Shahriar**, your batchmate, studying CSE at the Islamic University of Technology (IUT). I genuinely wanted to contribute, and here we go.

Please use **"Alt + Z"** to enable word wrap mode if you are viewing this code from VS Code; it will help you read without using the vertical bar.

However, I tried to write all the code by myself, taking very little help from AI. If you find any errors or have any suggestions, please let me know.

### Important Note:
I did not include an easy way to convert decimal to hexadecimal or vice versa in the provided solutions. However, here is a simple way to convert a decimal number to hexadecimal:

#### Decimal to Hexadecimal Conversion Code:

```
#include<stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a;
    scanf("%d", &a);  // Read the decimal number
    
    printf("%X", a);  // Print the hexadecimal equivalent
    return 0;
}
```

#### Hexadecimal to Decimal Conversion Code:
```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    unsigned int hex;
    scanf("%x", &hex);
    
    printf("Decimal equivalent: %d\n", hex);
    return 0;
}
```
However, these methods won't work if the user provides a fractional value; they only work if an integer value is given. Therefore, the traditional approach we learned in HSC is more applicable in this regard.
